## How to Install Playwright on Windows
Brokers like Schwab use playwright to render their website. This guide will show you how to install playwright on Windows since the recommended `playwright install` command doesn't work on Windows.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Close and reopen your terminal. Run `node -v` and `npx -v` to make sure NodeJS is installed correctly.
3. Run `npx playwright install` to install playwright.

If you have any issues, please check the [playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installing-playwright).
